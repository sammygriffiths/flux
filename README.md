#Flux

Flux is a lightweight application that eases the creation of simple, multi-level websites that do not require the use of a CMS.

## Why Flux?

A lot of the websites we do here at Via are small 'brochure' sites with even smaller profit margins, rather than oversell the need for a bloated CMS (especially for clients with tight budgets) we created Flux. Abstracted just enough at it's core, Flux is built upon the outstanding microframework Silex and some select components. It Allows us to create a multitude of sites quickly while still providing enough flexibility with custom page routing to be dangerous to more complex projects.

## To Do

It's still early days for Flux and there is a lot to do...
